  "summary": "Modern Earth where video game popularity has reached critical mass, creating 'Imprints' - resonance patterns that eventually manifest as physical 'Delves' where game logic overwrites reality. These pocket dimensions threaten to expand and corrupt baseline reality permanently unless specialized Heroes can enter them and restore harmonic balance. Each Delve reflects the genre and mechanics of whatever games created the original Imprint, leading to bizarre fusion spaces where fantasy dungeons might contain cyberpunk security systems, or horror mansions might have platformer physics.",
  "goals": "Penetrate the Delve's layers of corrupted game logic, locate the reality Anchor at its core, and perform the Silencing ritual to collapse the pocket dimension back into normal space-time before it reaches Stage 5 resonance and begins permanently overwriting baseline reality.",
  "victory_conditions": "Heroes win collectively by successfully completing enough Challenge thresholds to reduce the Delve's Resonance to zero, representing the successful disruption of the harmful frequency pattern. Individual victory is impossible - either the entire team succeeds in restoring harmonic balance, or they all fail as reality becomes permanently corrupted by the runaway Imprint.",

The Scout uses her persistent ability to peek at the next Delve card, revealing even worse challenges ahead. **Challenge Phase**: The team coordinates their approach. The Technomancer plays 'Viral Mythology Spreader' (3 [Technology], 1 [Logic]) for 2 Mind Drive, announcing it will boost other tech cards. The Warrior contributes 'Quantum Norse Hammer' (4 [Combat], 2 [Technology]) for 2 Body + 1 Mind Drive, hoping someone else has Norse/Quantum synergy. The Scout adds 'Cybernetic Reflexes' (3 [Agility], 1 [Technology]) for 1 Body Drive, and the Mystic plays 'Hacked Runes' (2 [Logic], 3 [Technology]) for 1 Mind + 1 Agility Drive. **Resolution Phase**: Cards are revealed simultaneously! The Viral Spreader boosts all other tech cards' secondary Tags by +1, so the team's total becomes: 3+2+1+3=9 [Technology] plus bonuses, and 4 [Combat]. The +1 bonus from Viral Spreader pushes their [Technology] total to 10, but they're still 2 short of the 12 needed and 2 short on [Combat]. The challenge fails! Resonance increases to Level 3, and each Hero must discard one card. **Refresh Phase**: Heroes restore Drive (Technomancer gains 1 Body, 3 Mind, 2 Agility), draw back to hand limit, and prepare for an even more dangerous Round 4 with higher escalation rates.

Summary: Modern Earth where video game popularity has reached critical mass, creating 'Imprints' - resonance patterns that eventually manifest as physical 'Delves' where game logic overwrites reality. These pocket dimensions threaten to expand and corrupt baseline reality permanently unless specialized Heroes can enter them and restore harmonic balance. Each Delve reflects the genre and mechanics of whatever games created the original Imprint, leading to bizarre fusion spaces where fantasy dungeons might contain cyberpunk security systems, or horror mansions might have platformer physics.",
