# Harmonic Breach: Campaign & Progression

This document describes the campaign structure, Avatar development, and reward exchange system that connects individual Delve sessions into a persistent progression arc.

## 1. Campaign Structure

Harmonic Breach is designed for **episodic campaign play** where a group of Heroes repeatedly delves into reality breaches across multiple sessions.

- Each session represents a **single Delve** with defined setup (Base + POI + Theme cards).  
- Between sessions, Heroes process rewards, develop their Avatars, and unlock permanent upgrades.  
- Campaign progression is cooperative—the team advances together.

### 1.1 Campaign Timeline

A full campaign typically consists of:

- **6–10 Delve sessions** of increasing difficulty.  
- Each Delve after the first introduces new mechanics, harder challenges, or narrative complications.  
- The final Delve represents the culminating threat that ties together the campaign arc.

### 1.2 Victory Conditions

- **Session Victory:** Reduce the Delve's Resonance to 0 before it reaches Resonance 5.  
- **Campaign Victory:** Successfully complete the final capstone Delve.  
- **Session Defeat:** If Resonance reaches 5, the team fails that Delve but may retry or move to a modified scenario.

## 2. Kept Challenge Rewards

During each Delve session, Challenges that are cleared with **Strong Success** or **Success** outcomes are **kept** in a session Reward Pool.

### 2.1 Post-Session Exchange

At the end of a session, the team collectively exchanges **Kept Challenge cards** for permanent improvements.

**Exchange rates (typical baseline):**

- **1 Kept Challenge card** → 1 Hero gains a permanent tableau slot upgrade (3 → 4 → 5 slots max).  
- **2 Kept Challenge cards** → 1 Hero unlocks a new Avatar ability or permanent passive.  
- **3 Kept Challenge cards** → Team unlocks a shared resource or campaign-wide advantage (e.g., starting with +1 Drive of each type in future Delves).

The exact exchange rates and available upgrades may vary by campaign design.

### 2.2 Distribution Rules

- The team decides **collectively** how to allocate exchanged rewards.  
- It is recommended that Heroes rotate receiving upgrades to maintain balanced progression.  
- Some campaigns may impose narrative restrictions (e.g., only certain Avatar types can unlock specific abilities).

## 3. Avatar Development

Each Hero's Avatar card represents their specialization and powers. Over the course of a campaign, Avatars gain:

### 3.1 Tableau Expansion

- **Starting tableau:** 3 slots per Hero.  
- **Mid-campaign:** 4 slots (unlocked via Kept Challenge exchange).  
- **Late-campaign:** 5 slots (unlocked via additional exchanges).

More tableau slots allow Heroes to maintain more persistent abilities and specialize more deeply.

### 3.2 Avatar Ability Unlocks

Each Avatar type (Warrior, Mystic, Scout, Technomancer, Detective) has a progression tree of abilities that can be unlocked through campaign rewards:

- **Tier 1 abilities:** Available at campaign start (printed on Avatar card).  
- **Tier 2 abilities:** Unlocked after 2–3 Delves (via Kept Challenge exchange).  
- **Tier 3 abilities:** Unlocked in late campaign (via Kept Challenge exchange or narrative milestones).

Example progression for **Quantum Mystic:**

- **Tier 1 (start):** Generate 1 Body, 4 Mind, 1 Agility Drive per Refresh. Persistent: Spend 1 Mind Drive to look at top 2 Delve cards.  
- **Tier 2 (mid-campaign unlock):** Persistent: Once per Delve, spend 3 Mind Drive to rewind one Challenge resolution and re-commit cards.  
- **Tier 3 (late-campaign unlock):** Exhaust: Spend 5 Mind Drive to prevent Resonance increase for one round.

### 3.3 Drive Generation Scaling

Avatars do **not** automatically generate more Drive as the campaign progresses. However:

- Team-wide unlocks may provide starting Drive bonuses for all future Delves.  
- Specific Avatar abilities may grant additional Drive generation under certain conditions.

## 4. Deck Evolution

Each Hero's 30-card Action deck can be modified between sessions.

### 4.1 Starting Deck

- At campaign start, each Hero builds a 30-card deck from their Avatar's pool of available cards.  
- Each Avatar type has access to a curated set of ~50–60 cards to choose from.

### 4.2 Campaign Deck Upgrades

Between sessions, Heroes may:

- **Swap cards:** Replace up to 3 cards in their deck with other cards from their Avatar's pool (free action).  
- **Unlock new cards:** Spend Kept Challenge rewards to add cards from a restricted/advanced pool to their Avatar's available options.  
- **Remove weak cards:** Some campaign milestones allow permanently removing basic cards to streamline the deck.

### 4.3 Deck Size

- **Always 30 cards** (unless a specific campaign rule modifies this).  
- Consistency is maintained to preserve balance and predictable hand cycling.

## 5. Campaign-Wide Unlocks

Some Kept Challenge exchanges grant benefits to the **entire team** rather than individual Heroes:

### 5.1 Examples of Team Unlocks

- **Shared Drive Bonus:** All Heroes start future Delves with +1 Drive of each type.  
- **Clue Token Reserve:** Team starts each Delve with 2 Clue tokens.  
- **Resonance Buffer:** First Resonance increase in each Delve is ignored.  
- **Advanced Utility Cards:** Unlock a shared pool of powerful utility cards any Hero can include in their deck.

### 5.2 Narrative Milestones

Some unlocks are tied to **story progression** rather than pure mechanical exchange:

- Completing a specific Delve may unlock a narrative advantage (e.g., "You've debugged the Abandoned Arcade; all Horror-themed Delves now start at Resonance 1 instead of 2").  
- Certain POI or Theme combinations may only become available after specific campaign milestones.

## 6. Retry and Failure States

### 6.1 Session Failure

If a Delve session ends in defeat (Resonance reaches 5):

- **No Kept Challenges** are earned from that session.  
- The team may **retry the same Delve** with the same or modified setup.  
- Alternatively, the GM may offer a **modified scenario** with adjusted difficulty or narrative consequences.

### 6.2 Campaign Failure

If the team fails the **final capstone Delve**, the campaign ends in defeat. However:

- Heroes keep all previously earned Avatar upgrades.  
- The team may choose to replay the capstone or start a new campaign with developed Avatars (New Game+ mode).

## 7. Campaign Pacing Recommendations

To maintain engagement and avoid power imbalances:

- **Distribute rewards evenly:** Rotate tableau upgrades and ability unlocks among Heroes.  
- **Scale Delve difficulty:** Increase Required Tag counts, introduce more complex Resonance effects, or add Boss-type Challenges as the campaign progresses.  
- **Introduce narrative stakes:** Tie Delve outcomes to story consequences to maintain tension even as Heroes grow stronger.
